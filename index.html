            <p>
      When I left the UK to study in Canada, I knew I wanted to maintain an interdisciplinary approach to my studies.
		    As such, I spent my four years in Canada cultivating an understanding of both Philosophy and Biology.
		    Only after a few years of this did it become clear to me that the two fields were not disjointed and 
		    distinct; instead, they were attempting to provide an understanding of ourselves and our place in the
		    world around us and give prescriptions about what we should do given this knowledge. It is this point 
		    where the two meet that I find most interesting. In my studies I have cultivated skills in concise and 
		    clear scientific writing, developing original theses, coding in HTML and R (self-taught), First Order 
		    and Mathematical Logic, and have been exposed to an array of different literature (both scientific, 
		    philosophical and otherwise). My interests outside of my studies include film photography, reading and 
		    writing, hiking, skiing, an interest in wildlife that 
		    took me to Costa Rica for 2 weeks following my graduation, cultivating a variety of houseplants (I have
		    successfully grown tomatoes and avocados indoors), and cooking.

                      <p>In my independent studies with Professor Abouheif at McGill, we were assessing the possibility
			      of leg striping as an atavism or ancestral potential. It became clear that, in order to 
			      complete this project, it is necessary to understand the way striping emerges and whether
			      there are regional biases across and within legs. To assess this, we counted the number of 
			      stripes and assessed their location using ImageJ. With this coordinate data, I constructed
			      heat maps to demonstrate the pattern. The paper is incomplete but the other undergraduate
			      researcher and I are working to finish and publish it when possible.</p>

                      <p>These essays comprise of two Final Assignments from Biology classes in my last year. One is from a 4th year (400 level) class on Conservation Biology
			  while the other is from an MSc (500 level) class on Species Invasions. In the former I had to carry out research on a topic of my choosing using 
			      online resources - I elected to write a meta-analysis on Invasive species in National Parks in the USA. For the latter class,
			  we had to come up with a research proposal. This consisted of deciding on a topic and developing a thesis, then giving a presentation
			  on the thesis, its methods, significance, and potential outcomes. I decided to write my proposal on the Nature of Invasive Species in 
			  Urban Areas, and why this poses a unique and multidimensional problem to the theory of invasion ecology. Both papers received A grades for their
			      argumentation style, originality of thesis, and manipulation of class material. They can be found in the links below.

                      <p>These three Philosophy papers span across my last two years and were all Final Essays for 4th year courses. First, PHIL 480 was
			  a class on phenomenology and technology using the works of Martin Heidegger and Edmund Husserl. My paper focused on the Natural Sciences
			  as providing a means of escape from the issues of a technologically enframed perspective, and their ultimate failure to overcome these issues 
			  due to a fundamental technisation of their very focus (ie Nature). The second, PHIL 474 was an introduction to Heidegger and Phenomenology 
			  through a detailed analysis of his Being and Time. My essay focused on the phenomenological versus psychology perspectives of Anxiety and 
			  my belief that the Phenomenological perspectives ultimately provides answers and a view on Anxiety that overcomes the issues of psychology. This
			  essay also drew from Husserl's Crisis in the Sciences, and critiqued the limitations around the Scientific perspective. The final class was 
			  taken in my last year - PHIL 475. This class was on the limits of Phenomenology and the responses to such limits. In order to frame the limits, I took 
			  a Derridian Deconstructive position, and looked at the works of Kierkegaard, Freud, and Heidegger on Anxiety. This enabled a holistic and deeper view
			  of the notion as well as possible prescriptions (a capacity that Heidegger on his own lacks). These essays all contributed to my receiving an A, A and 
			  A- in each of the respective classes and can be read below.</p>
