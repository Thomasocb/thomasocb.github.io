            <p>
               When I left the UK to study in Canada I knew I wanted to maintain an interdisciplinary 
			   approach to my studies. As such, I spent my four years in Canada cultivating an understanding
			   of both Philosophy and Biology. Only after a few years of this did it become clear 
			   to me that the two fields were not disjointed and distinct, instead they were attempting
			   to provide an understanding of ourselves and our place in the world around us, and give
			   prescriptions about what we should do given this knowledge. It is this point where the two meet
		    	   that I find most interesting. In my studies I have cultivated skills in concise and 
		    	   clear scientific writing, developing original theses, coding in HTML and R (self-taught), 
		           First Order and Mathematical Logic, and I have been exposed to an array of 
		    	   different literature (both scientific, philosophical and otherwise). My interests outside 
		    	   of my studies include film photography, reading and writing, hiking, skiing, an interest 
		           in wildlife that took me to Costa Rica for 2 weeks following my graduation, cultivating a variety 
		           of houseplants (I have successfully grown tomatoes and avocados indoors), and an avid interest in cooking.

                    Working under the supervision of Professor Abouheif in his Evolutionary Developmental Biology lab, working alongside

                <p> As an undergraduate researcher I used R, through GitHub, to collaboratively make sense of a series of beach seines. This

		across the west coast of North America from San Diego to Alaska. The position culminated in a research paper after 4 months which
		could be used to assist graduate dissertations.

                      <p>In my independent studies with Professor Abouheif at McGill we were assessing the possibility of leg striping as an atavism,
						 or ancestral potential. It became clear that a necessary aspect to understand was the way striping emerges and whether
						 there are regional biases across and within legs. To assess this we counted the number of stripes and assessed their location
						 using ImageJ. With this coordinate Data I constructed heat maps to demonstrate the pattern. The paper is incomplete but the other
						 undergraduate researcher and I are working to finish and publish the paper if possible.</p>
